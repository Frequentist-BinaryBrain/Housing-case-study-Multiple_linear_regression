# Problem Statement
Consider that a real estate company has data about real estate prices in Delhi. The company wants to optimize the selling price of its properties, based on important factors such as area, bedrooms, parking, etc.
 
# Essentially, the company wants:
●	To identify the variables affecting house prices, e.g., area, number of rooms, bathrooms, etc.
●	To create a linear model that quantitatively relates house prices with variables, such as the number of rooms, area, number of bathrooms, etc.
●	To know the accuracy of the model, i.e., how well these variables predict house prices
